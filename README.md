## About

Push_swap is a sorting algorithm project where the goal is to sort a stack of integers using the minimum number of operations. The program receives a list of integers as arguments and outputs the sequence of operations needed to sort them using two stacks (A and B) and a specific set of allowed operations.

**Key Objectives:**
- Sort integers in ascending order using two stacks
- Minimize the number of operations
- Handle edge cases and invalid inputs
- Implement efficient algorithms for different stack sizes

## Algorithm

The program uses different sorting strategies based on the stack size:

- **2-3 elements**: Simple comparison-based sorting
- **4-5 elements**: Optimized sorting with minimal operations
- **6+ elements**: Radix sort algorithm for efficiency

### Radix Sort Implementation
For larger stacks, the program implements a radix sort algorithm that:
1. Assigns index values to each number based on their relative position
2. Sorts by binary digits (bits) from least significant to most significant
3. Uses stack B as temporary storage during the sorting process

## ⚙️ Operations

The program can use the following operations:

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `sa` | Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack A |
| `sb` | Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack B |
| `ss` | `sa` and `sb` at the same time |
| `pa` | Push the first element of stack B to the top of stack A |
| `pb` | Push the first element of stack A to the top of stack B |
| `ra` | Rotate stack A (first element becomes last) |
| `rb` | Rotate stack B (first element becomes last) |
| `rr` | `ra` and `rb` at the same time |
| `rra` | Reverse rotate stack A (last element becomes first) |
| `rrb` | Reverse rotate stack B (last element becomes first) |
| `rrr` | `rra` and `rrb` at the same time |

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd push_swap
```

2. Compile the program:
```bash
make
```

3. Clean object files (optional):
```bash
make clean
```

4. Full cleanup:
```bash
make fclean
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
./push_swap 4 67 3 87 23
```

### Examples
```bash
# Sort a simple sequence
./push_swap 2 1 3
# Output: sa

# Sort a random sequence
./push_swap 5 2 8 1 9
# Output: pb ra pb ra sa pa pa

# Handle negative numbers
./push_swap -1 3 -5 10
```

### Error Cases
The program handles various error cases:
```bash
./push_swap 1 2 3 2    # Duplicate numbers
./push_swap 1 two 3    # Non-numeric input
./push_swap            # No arguments (exits silently)
```

## Implementation Details

### Data Structure
The program uses a linked list to represent each stack:
```c
typedef struct s_list
{
    long        data;    // The integer value
    int         index;   // Index for radix sort
    struct s_list *next; // Pointer to next element
} t_list;
```

### Input Validation
- Checks for non-numeric characters
- Validates integer overflow/underflow
- Detects duplicate numbers
- Handles edge cases (empty input, single element)

### Memory Management
- Proper allocation and deallocation of linked list nodes
- Error handling with appropriate cleanup
- No memory leaks

### Sorting Strategies
1. **2 elements**: Single swap if needed
2. **3 elements**: Optimized 3-element sort with minimal operations
3. **4-5 elements**: Strategic use of both stacks
4. **6+ elements**: Radix sort with binary bit manipulation

## Performance

The algorithm aims for optimal performance:
- **3 numbers**: ≤ 3 operations
- **5 numbers**: ≤ 12 operations  
- **100 numbers**: ≤ 700 operations (typically ~550)
- **500 numbers**: ≤ 5500 operations (typically ~4000)
